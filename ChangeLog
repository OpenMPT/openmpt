ModPlug-XMMS v2.0 / libmodplug v0.7, Oct. 27, 2001
+ ModPlug rendering engine moved into a separate library --
  libmodplug created.

* Endianness bugs fixed by Adam Goode.  Should work on PPC now.

ModPlug-XMMS v1.5a
- Due to a misunderstanging between Olivier (creator of ModPlug) and
  myself, I incorrectly reported that version 1.5 had polyphase and
  spline resampling when this was not the case.

+ Added (for real this time!) spline and 8-tap fir resampling modes,
  written by Markus Fick.

* Preamp now correctly saves its state when you exit.
* Other minor bug fixes.

ModPlug-XMMS v1.5, Jan. 24, 2001
+ Latest Modplug sound engine, including the following changes:
  + Polyphase resampling.  I don't know what this is, but it sounds
    good.  :)  (Reminder:  I, Kenton Varda, did not write the sound
    engine.  Olivier did that. :)
  + Support for MT2 and PSM mod formats.
  * Obscure pitch-shifting bug fixed.  Now you can play IT files
    generated by OpenSPC, among other things.

+ Bzip2 support contributed by Colin DeVilbiss <crdevilb@mtu.edu>.
+ Configurable preamp.

* Changed endianness setting to make big-endian (PPC) ports work
  again.

ModPlug-XMMS v1.3, Jul. 17, 2000
+ Looping!  Check the configure dialog.
+ New IT filters, using the same algorithm as impulse tracker itself.
+ IT file comments supported.

* No more crash when you press stop while paused.
* Blank mod names are replaced by the filename.
* Possibly works on Solaris-x86 now.
* Better zip and rar support.  (should support every archive now)
* Compiles faster (almost twice as fast!).
* Glade project files are now included with the source code.

ModPlug-XMMS v1.2, Apr. 10, 2000
+ New file formats recognised:
    S3Z, S3R, S3GZ, XMZ, XMR, XMGZ, ITZ, ITR, ITGZ
  These are all compressed file formats.  Note that the compression
  format of a compressed mod is determined by extension, but the mod
  format is NOT.  So, you could zip an XM and give it the extension
  MDZ and it would work.
+ If you try to load a ZIP, RAR, or GZ file that happens to contain a
  mod, it will be played.

* Multi-file archives work.  Only the first mod found in the archive
  will be played, but non-mods will be ignored as they should be.
* Buffering fix.  If you were experiencing choppy sound before, try
  this version.
* File info for compressed mods works.
* Trying to close a window using the window manager's close button
  no longer causes crashes.
* Compressed mods with spaces either in the internal filename or in
  the archive's filename work fine.

ModPlug-XMMS v1.1.1, Feb. 28, 2000
* Fixed minor installation bug that could have affected a few systems.

ModPlug-XMMS v1.1, Feb. 28, 2000
+ Latest ModPlug source from Olivier Lapique.
+ You can now play compressed mods of the following formats:
  - .MDZ: Standard zipped mod.
  - .MDR: Rar compressed mod.
  - .MDGZ: Gzipped mod.  (not available on Windoze! :)
  Note: To play these formats, you need to have the associated
  decompression utilities (unzip, gunzip, unrar) installed.  To see
  if you have them installed, try typing the commands at the command
  line.

* gtk-- is no longer required.
* Fixed bug where files with capitalized extensions did not have their
  names loaded until they were played.
* GUI looks a bit nicer.
* Easier to install.  (automake/autoconf)
