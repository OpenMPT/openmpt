libopus library version 1.6.1 (2026-01-15).
The following changes have been made:
 *  Obviously, unnecessary folders and files have been removed.
 *  celt/float_cast.h has been modified to compile on ARM64EC.
 *  celt/x86/vq_sse2.c has been modified to check for OPUS_X86_MAY_HAVE_SSE2.
 *  celt/x86/x86_arch_macros.h has been modified to not set architecture macros.
 *  A warning in dnn/dred_encoder.c has been silenced.
 *  The following files have been fixed to check for Opus architecture macros
    instead of relying on compiler-specific ones which the code was really
    really confused about:
     *  dnn/nnet.c
     *  dnn/nnet_default.c
     *  dnn/vec.h
     *  dnn/vec_avx.h
     *  dnn/x86/nnet_avx2.h
     *  dnn/x86/nnet_sse2.h
     *  dnn/x86/nnet_sse4_1.h
 *  silk/float/x86/inner_product_FLP_avx2 has been modified to check for
    OPUS_X86_MAY_HAVE_AVX2.
 *  silk/x86/*sse4_1.c has been modified to check for OPUS_X86_MAY_HAVE_SSE4_1.
 *  silk/x86/NSQ_del_dec_avx2.c has been modified to check for
    OPUS_X86_MAY_HAVE_AVX2.
 *  OpenMPT modifications are marked with "/* OpenMPT */".
 *  For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
    See ../build/premake/ for details.
