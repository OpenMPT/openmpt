libmpg123 library version 1.33.1 (2025-07-27).
The following changes have been made:
 *  `ports/generic/config.h` has been added for build system independent builds.
 *  `src/compat/compat.c` has been modified to silence MSVC static analyzer
    warnings.
 *  `src/compat/compat.c` and `src/compat/compat.h` have been modified to
    exclude unneeded functionality.
 *  `src/libmpg123/dct64_i386.c`, `src/libmpg123/dct64_i486.c`,
    `src/libmpg123/synth_i486.c`, `src/libmpg123/synth_real.c`,
    and `src/libmpg123/synth_s32.c` have been modified to build in all
    build configurations.
 *  Modifications are marked by `// OpenMPT` or `/* OpenMPT */`.
 *  Obviously, unnecessary folders and files have been removed.
 *  For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
    See ../build/premake/ for details.
