flac 1.3.4.
The FLAC package has been left pretty much untouched, except for a few changes:
 *  Obviously, unnecessary folders and files (documentation, makefiles, etc.) have
    been removed.
 *  For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
    See ../build/premake/ for details.
