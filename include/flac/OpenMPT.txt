The FLAC package has been left pretty much untouched, except for a few changes:
- Obviously, unnecessary folders and files (documentation, makefiles, etc.) have
  been removed.
- src/share/win_utf8_io/win_utf8_io.c has been modified to compile with UNICODE.
  Only additions were made and those are mared with // OpenMPT
- For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
  See ../build/premake/ for details.
